    <p>A RDF Document is a graph. Sometime it is useful to see these RDF
    Document like a graph into a image. Morla can create these images and
    it opens them with the default image viewer of your operating system
    You can change the image viewer into the preferences window.</p>

    <p>The menu <i>graph</i> contains some options to the graph creating.
    You can create graph of the current RDF Document, merge more documents
    in a single graph image, and a lot of other stuff.</p>

    <p>The preferences flags permit you to change colors, sizes, forms
    and any other elements of the image graphs.</p>

    <p>Morla uses graphviz to create the image files. If you want, morla can
    generate a source code written in the graphviz's syntax. This option is,
    of course, into the <i>graph</i> menu.
