    <p>If you want create new RDF Documents or add RDF Triples a existing
    document you should understand what the vocabolaries are.
    When Morla tells you something about vocabolaries, it speaks about
    <b>RDF Schema Document</b> (<b>RDFS</b>), lists of Classes and Properties
    to describe resources. If you import in Morla a vocabulary, you can use
    its properties and its classes in your RDF Documents.</p>

    <p>If you want import a new vocabulary, you must you the menu <i>RDFS</i>.
    You can import RDFS if you know its URI and if you set a prefix. The
    prefix is a conventional name like <i>dc</i> for dublincore RDFS.
    Morla will be able to call that vocabolary inside your RDF Documents.</p>

    <p>In the menu <i>RDFS</i> (or from the toolbar) morla can show the list
    for imported vocabularies. Use the button if you want remove, add, change
    a vocabulary.</p>

    <p>You can import a vocabulary also from a RDF Document. On the bottom,
    in the main window, you can see the list of vocabularies of the current
    RDF Document. If you click on one of them (right click or double click),
    a menu appears and you can import that vocabulary.</p>

    <p>Morla imports only valid RDF Document. So, If you recive an error,
    probaly, that URI is not a valid RDF Document.</p>
