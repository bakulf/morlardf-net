<h2>About morla...</h2>
<p>
Morla is a multiplatform editor of RDF documents. It is based on
<a href="https://github.com/bakulf/libnxml">libnxml</a> and
<a href="http://librdf.org">librdf</a> libraries. With Morla you can
manage more RDF documents simultaneously, visualize graphs, use templates
for quick writing and exec SPARQL/RDQL queries.
</p>

<p>
With Morla you can import RDFS documents and use its content to write new
RDF triples. Templates are also RDF documents and they make Morla easily
personalizeble and expandable. You can use javascript codes into your
templates so you can validate, change, the user inputs.
</p>

<p>
Morla is also a modular software so you can add functionality about the save,
open and view procedures.
</p>

<p>
You can also use Morla as RDF navigator, wandering among the net knots of the
RDF documents present on internet exactly as we are used to do with normal
browsers.
